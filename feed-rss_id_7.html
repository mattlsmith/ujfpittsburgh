Gratz’s NEXT (New Excellent Teacher Training) program is an intensive program that consists of a series of four-week courses designed to build the skills and knowledge that part-time Jewish educators need.&#160;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"&gt;The Jewish Life and Learning Department will subsidize the cost of tuition for one course as well as provide a stipend for part-time Jewish educators in Pittsburgh who have preapproval from their principals. The arrangements may apply to the NEXT session that begins Feb. 27, 2017. Gratz College will offer three more four-week sessions in 2017.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"&gt;The NEXT program is designed to provide individualized professional development for teachers. Rabbi Amy Bardack, director of Jewish Life and Learning of the Jewish Federation of Greater Pittsburgh, believes the program will fill a gap in teaching.&#160;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"&gt;&#8220;Teachers who have Jewish knowledge but lack formal education training can learn basic pedagogy through the Boot Camp for New Teachers course. Those ready to expand their tools can learn about incorporating the arts or project-based learning,&#8221; Bardack explained.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"&gt;Course participants come from all areas of the United States, and course instructors have expertise in Jewish supplemental schools. The program is offered four times per year, with each course involving about two hours of study per week for four weeks. NEXT courses are asynchronous — that is, weekly study may occur at each student’s convenience.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"&gt;Course topics cover a range of subjects, including the arts, project-based learning, addressing special needs, Jews and politics, and Hebrew through movement. All courses are taught by experts who have experience in Jewish supplemental school settings.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"&gt;&#8220;Strengthening the skills of part-time Jewish educators is essential to engaging and retaining the more than 1,000 Pittsburgh-area students in our part-time religious education programs, including congregation-based K-7 programs and community-wide high school programs,&#8221; Bardack continued.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"&gt;Gratz College of Melrose Park, Pa., has been a pioneer in higher education and Jewish education since it opened, in 1895. Gratz is the oldest pluralistic college for Jewish studies in North America and the oldest independent college offering Jewish studies. In addition, Gratz holds the distinction of being the first institution of advanced Jewish learning to accept women on par with men.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"&gt;Other Jewish Federations partnering with Gratz College to provide NEXT teacher training are the Federations of Baltimore, Broward County (Florida), Cleveland, Detroit, Palm Beach County (Florida), Hartford, Houston, Los Angeles, Miami, Milwaukee, and Philadelphia.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"&gt;For more information, please contact Rabbi Amy Bardack, director of Jewish Life and Learning at the Jewish Federation of Greater Pittsburgh, at &lt;a href="mailto:abardack@jfedpgh.org"&gt;abardack@jfedpgh.org&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"&gt;To register, visit &lt;a href="http://www.gratz.edu/next" target="Gratz"&gt;www.gratz.edu/NEXT&lt;/a&gt; or email &lt;a href="mailto:NEXT@gratz.edu"&gt;NEXT@gratz.edu&lt;/a&gt; or call 215.635.7300 ext. 135.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 10 Feb 2017 08:52:00 GMT</pubDate><category>JLL</category><category>Gratz College</category><category>teacher</category><category>training</category><category>NEXT</category><category>elementary</category><category>high school</category><category>part-time</category><category>educator</category><category>subsidize</category><category>tuition</category><category>professional development</category><category>art</category><category>project-based learning</category><category>special needs</category><category>politics</category><category>Hebrew</category><category>movement</category><guid isPermaLink="false">d1c3bf2c-8136-46f2-97da-6c3136a37b2d</guid></item><item><title>JEWISH FEDERATION OF GREATER PITTSBURGH’S COMMUNITY RELATIONS COUNCIL TAKES SERIOUS ISSUE WITH EXECUTIVE ORDER ON REFUGEES AND IMMIGRANTS</title><link>http://ujfpittsburgh.org/News</link><description>&lt;p id="executive-order"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://ujfpittsburgh.org/file/press-releases/2017/Immigration-exec-order-Jan.-31-2017-edit-2.pdf?erid=0" runat="server" target="executive%20order" pid="0" did="378" tab="0"&gt;&lt;img alt="Download as PDF" height="25" src="http://ujfpittsburgh.org/image/digest-icons/pdf_icon_transparent.gif" width="25" /&gt;&#160;&lt;em&gt;View PDF Version of this Press Release&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://jfedpgh.org/CRC"&gt;&lt;img alt="Community Relations Council" height="250" src="http://ujfpittsburgh.org/image/logos/CRC-400x400.png" style="float: left; margin-left: 10px; margin-bottom: 5px; margin-right: 10px;" width="250" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The Community Relations Council (CRC) of the Jewish Federation of Greater Pittsburgh takes serious issue with Friday’s Presidential Executive Order, which imposes a four-month suspension on the United States refugee program and bars all immigration from seven Muslim countries - Libya, Iran, Iraq, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen - for 90 days. The current executive order is counter to a stated policy priority of Jewish Federations of North America, which calls for &#8220;safeguarding the U.S. refugee program.&#8221; We support the statements from Jewish Federations and Jewish Community Relations Councils throughout the country, as well as from the Religious Action Center of Reform Judaism, the Conservative Movement, and the Orthodox Union and Rabbinical Council of America, which raise concerns about the executive order.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"&gt;&#8220;The core Jewish value of welcoming the stranger is not only found in our texts, but also in the work of our Jewish agencies both locally and nationally,&#8221; said Cindy Goodman-Leib, Chair of CRC. &#8220;It is critical that we do not turn our backs on millions and millions of people in their greatest hour of need.&#8221;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"&gt;The Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society (HIAS) handled 159 requests by Jews seeking asylum in the United States in 2016, according to a Jan. 30, 2017, report by the Jewish Telegraphic Agency (JTA). More than 90 of those requests came from Iran and Yemen, two of the seven countries from which the executive order bans all forms of immigration.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"&gt;Additionally, Jewish Family &amp; Children’s Service of Pittsburgh (JF&amp;CS), a constituent agency of the Jewish Federation of Greater Pittsburgh that plays a significant role in resettling refugees in Southwestern Pennsylvania, is directly harmed by the executive order.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"&gt;&#8220;We recognize the weighty responsibility of protecting Americans from the increasing threat of terrorists and other extremists, whether foreign or domestic,&#8221; said Goodman-Leib. &#8220;But by moving too quickly and without engaging many important stakeholders both within the government and civic society, the administration has fallen short of its obligation. Rather than improving safety and security, the executive order has raised anxiety and sown fear and confusion while abridging the civil rights of legal American residents.&#8221;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"&gt;CRC calls upon the administration to reconsider its executive order, and to collaborate with a wide range of diverse partners in order to balance the American and Jewish value of welcoming the stranger with appropriate security protocols.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 31 Jan 2017 21:59:00 GMT</pubDate><category>Presidential Executive Order</category><category>immigrant</category><category>refugee</category><category>CRC</category><category>Libya</category><category>Iran</category><category>Iraq</category><category>Somalia</category><category>Sudan</category><category>Syria</category><category>Yemen</category><category>Cindy Goodman-Leib</category><category>HIAS</category><category>JTA</category><category>JF&CS</category><guid isPermaLink="false">34e312fb-1bda-410e-b699-b3a2a5d9d2f5</guid></item><item><title>JEWISH COMMUNITY FOUNDATION 2017 GRANT FUNDING AVAILABLE </title><link>http://ujfpittsburgh.org/News</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://ujfpittsburgh.org/file/press-releases/2017/1-26-17_Foundation-Grantmaking-RFP_FINAL.pdf?erid=0" runat="server" target="grants" pid="0" did="374" tab="0"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;img alt="Download as PDF" height="25" src="http://ujfpittsburgh.org/image/digest-icons/pdf_icon_transparent.gif" width="25" /&gt;&#160;View PDF Version of this Press Release&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"&gt;The Jewish Community Foundation of the Jewish Federation of Greater Pittsburgh is now accepting grant applications for 2017.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"&gt;In 2017, the Foundation is making approximately $320,000 available to fund programs and projects that address vital human needs, support lifelong Jewish learning and create a vibrant and dynamic Jewish community in Pittsburgh.&#160;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"&gt;Of the total, approximately $270,000 will be available to fund &#8220;Signature Grants&#8221; - grants to fund initiatives that are intended to have a significant impact on the long-term vitality of the Pittsburgh Jewish community. These grants are intended to be transformative, with the goal of making a substantial intervention that has broad community impact.&#160;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"&gt;&#8220;The hope is for organizations to tackle the big questions facing our Jewish community in Pittsburgh,&#8221; said Woody Ostrow, chair of the Jewish Community Foundation Grantmaking Committee. &#8220;We want you to envision the Jewish Pittsburgh of the future - one that serves all 54,000 of us. We’re looking to make big investments in projects that will accomplish that.&#8221;&#160;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"&gt;Additionally, $50,000 will be available for &#8220;Micro Grants,&#8221; which fund one-time projects in Pittsburgh’s Jewish community that align with the Jewish Federation’s mission and goals. Micro Grants range from approximately $5,000 to $15,000.&#160;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"&gt;The Jewish Community Foundation has already committed $525,000 in continuing funds for multiyear grants awarded during last year’s grant cycle. All told, the Foundation will allocate approximately $845,000 in grants in 2017.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"&gt;The grant application - available online at http://jfedpgh.org/foundation-grants - must be submitted by 5 p.m., Tuesday, March 14, for consideration in the spring grant cycle. Awardees will be notified in June.&#160;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"&gt;Some examples of recent grants include:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li style="margin-bottom: 5px;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"&gt;$325,000 to facilitate a new Community Study, which will produce a profile of the Pittsburgh Jewish community, enabling a better understanding of our demographics, activities and needs.&#160;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li style="margin-bottom: 5px;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"&gt;$125,000 to support a community scholar - Rabbi Danny Schiff - who provides Jewish education and Jewish content to diverse populations in the community.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li style="margin-bottom: 5px;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"&gt;$6,000 to the Rosh Pina Cornerstone Fellowship, which supports a year-long organizational-change project for leaders of the Jewish Family &amp; Children's Service, Jewish Residential Services, and Jewish Federation to increase disability inclusion opportunities throughout the Pittsburgh Jewish community.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li style="margin-bottom: 5px;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"&gt;$7,500 to support Repair the World Pittsburgh in expanding its food justice programming and partnerships.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"&gt;The Jewish Community Foundation, the planned giving arm of the Jewish Federation of Greater Pittsburgh, enables donors to create permanent endowment funds that address community needs in perpetuity.

The sessions focus on how to talk to your children about tough topics, the happiness of our children and the steps you should take to create a peaceful home. The workshops — all on Sundays, 9:30-11 a.m. — will be Jan. 22, March 5 and April 2 in the Falk Library of Rodef Shalom Congregation,&#160;5905 Fifth Ave., Pittsburgh 15213. Each workshop will feature a different topic.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"&gt;To best meet the needs of families, each workshop will be live-streamed to Temple Emanuel of South Hills, 1250 Bower Hill Road, Mt. Lebanon (Pittsburgh 15243) and Temple Ohav Shalom, 8400 Thompson Run Road, Allison Park 15101.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"&gt;Dr. Gilboa has an extensive background in child care as a family physician at the Squirrel Hill Health Center, in addition to being an international speaker, author, media expert, regular contributor on the &#8220;TODAY&#8221; show and mother of four boys. Her experience inspires audiences with relatable stories and easy tools to develop crucial life skills for children.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"&gt;Last year, as part of the Jewish Federation’s early childhood education initiatives, the Jewish Life and Learning Division of the Jewish Federation of Greater Pittsburgh partnered with our community’s Jewish early education centers and administered a school, educator and parent survey. The results showed that parents of young children wanted to enhance their parenting skills, suggesting the need for Gilboa’s parenting workshops.&#160;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"&gt;&#8220;A parenting class can give you better insight into your child so that you can become the best parent possible. Regardless of the age of your children, a parenting class can help you&#160;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"&gt;become a more confident parent as you learn strategies to stay close to your children and to raise them to be functioning members of society,&#8221; Jewish Federation’s Director of Early Childhood Education Carolyn Linder said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"&gt;Ten local Jewish early childhood education programs and PJ Library, which is run by the Jewish Community Center of Greater Pittsburgh, have partnered with the Jewish Federation to support the parenting workshops:&#160;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div style="padding: 0 1rem;"&gt; &lt;table border="0"&gt; &lt;tbody&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td style="padding: .5rem;"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"&gt;Adat Shalom&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td style="padding: .5rem;"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"&gt; Early Learning Center of Yeshiva&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td style="padding: .5rem;"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"&gt; Beth Shalom Early Learning Center&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td style="padding: .5rem;"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"&gt; Temple Ohav Shalom Center for Early Learning&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td style="padding: .5rem;"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"&gt; The Early Childhood Education program at Community Day School&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td style="padding: .5rem;"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"&gt; Rodef Shalom Family Center Preschool&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td style="padding: .5rem;"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"&gt; The Isadore Joshowitz Early Childhood Center at Hillel Academy of Pittsburgh&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td style="padding: .5rem;"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"&gt;Temple Emanuel Early Childhood Development Center&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td style="padding: .5rem;"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"&gt; Jewish Community Center of Pittsburgh, Early Childhood Development Centers in Squirrel Hill&#160;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td style="padding: .5rem;"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"&gt; Jewish Community Center of Pittsburgh, Early Childhood Development Centers and the South Hills&#160;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;/tbody&gt; &lt;/table&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"&gt;Director of the Beth Shalom Early Learning Center, Jennifer Perer Slattery, expressed her excitement as an educator about Dr. Gilboa’s presentations: &#8220;This series of workshops with Dr. G are a direct response to [parents’ needs], and the Beth Shalom Early Learning Center is truly delighted to be partnering with the other Jewish early childhood centers and the Jewish Federation on this community initiative.&#8221;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"&gt;&#8220;These sessions are practical tools,&#8221; said Dr. Gilboa. &#8220;I hope parents come in with questions about real-life issues they’re facing.

Orsini as director of Jewish community security. In this new position, Mr. Orsini will plan, direct and coordinate activities relating to the protection and security of the Jewish Federation and of Pittsburgh’s Jewish community organizations, including day schools, synagogues and Jewish communal organizations. Mr. Orsini will start his new position&#160;Jan. 3, 2017.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"&gt;&#8220;With his wealth of experience, the Jewish Federation and the Pittsburgh Jewish community are very fortunate to have Brad Orsini as our security director,&#8221; said Milo Averbach, chief financial officer of the Jewish Federation and the staff person in charge of the hiring process.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"&gt;Mr. Orsini has been with the United States Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) for more than 25 years and is currently the supervisory special agent, crisis manager and training coordinator for the Pittsburgh Division. Past experience includes work with the FBI on the Public Corruption Squad in New Jersey, on the Crisis Management Team in Pittsburgh and as the supervisor of the FBI’s Community Outreach Program in Pittsburgh.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"&gt;A fund within the Jewish Community Foundation of the Jewish Federation of Greater Pittsburgh provided resources to establish the new position. Position responsibilities include assessing Jewish community needs, recommending measures to strengthen existing security measures, and coordinating with Jewish agencies and government first responders.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"&gt;&#8220;Security events affecting the Jewish community — including shootings, acts of terrorism and other attacks — have become increasingly common around the world. Coordinating security, training employees and volunteers, and implementing best practices will help to deter these crimes and prevent or decrease danger to Jewish Pittsburgh if they occur,&#8221; said Jeffrey Finkelstein, president and CEO of the Jewish Federation of Greater Pittsburgh.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"&gt;Andrew Stewart chairs the Jewish Federation ad hoc committee that explored the need for the security director and led the hiring process. Mr. Stewart commented, &#8220;Our community Jewish organizations have many appropriate measures in place, but there is definitely more that a security expert can bring to these efforts. From the experience of other communities around the country, we know that our Jewish community would benefit from the coordination, training and professional support for security initiatives that someone in this role could provide.&#8221;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"&gt;The Jewish Federation of Greater Pittsburgh worked with the Secure Community Network (SCN), a national homeland security initiative of the Jewish Federations of North America, to evaluate the need for a security director. In addition, SCN assisted with the hiring process.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"&gt;Mr. Orsini will work with the community to develop goals and objectives and will develop, implement and monitor guidelines, procedures and programs to coordinate security and incident response to reach these goals. In addition, he will help to build relationships and coordinate activities with local, state and federal law enforcement agencies.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"&gt;Mr. Orsini received his bachelor of science, administration of justice degree from Pennsylvania State University in 1985 and served in the United States Marine Corps, reaching the rank of captain. During his previous work in Pittsburgh, he grew the Southwestern Pennsylvania Anti-Human Trafficking Coalition and was awarded the FBI’s Law Enforcement Agency Directors Award in 2005 for outstanding investigative results in the area of public corruption for Western Pennsylvania. In 2015, he was again awarded the Western Pennsylvania Law Enforcement Agency Directors Award for leading the FBI’s response to several mass-casualty critical incidents, including the Franklin Regional High School stabbing and the Monroeville Mall shooting. In September 2016, Mr. Orsini was awarded the FBI Director’s Award for Excellence in Training and Professional Development.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 06 Dec 2016 22:00:00 GMT</pubDate><category>Bradley W.

Planning for the study will start immediately.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"&gt;The purpose of the study, the first such effort since 2002, will be to estimate the current number and geographic distribution of individuals and households in the greater Pittsburgh community who identify as Jewish and to collect data on community members’ behaviors and attitudes about Jewish practice and about the Jewish community.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"&gt;The study will reveal where Jews are living within Pittsburgh as well as what are the behaviors and attitudes of community members throughout the greater Pittsburgh area. Questions addressed will include, &#8220;How do Jewish Pittsburghers understand their Jewish identities? How do they connect (if at all) with organized Jewish institutions? What do they expect, need and want from our Jewish community?&#8221;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"&gt;The answers to these questions and others will enhance the community’s ability to plan for the future by focusing on the most pressing communal needs.

It will give us a new perspective on community needs and will equip us with the knowledge to identify any gaps in service and new areas of opportunity.&#8221;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"&gt;The Jewish Federation has selected the Marilyn and Maurice Cohen Center for Modern Jewish Studies (CMJS) at Brandeis University’s Steinhardt Social Research Institute (SSRI) to lead the study. The Community Scorecard committee selected CMJS/SSRI from among seven nationally renowned firms invited to apply as part of a formal request for proposals.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"&gt;The Jewish Federation’s Jewish Community Foundation funded the study to provide relevant data and analytic frameworks that can support informed decision making by the Federation and service providers. This data and analysis will improve planning, service delivery and fundraising and marketing as well as help Jewish agencies to connect people to Jewish community life.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"&gt;Deborah Baron, Chief Operating Officer of the Jewish Federation, said, &#8220;The community study will illuminate our path to becoming a community of excellence, showing us areas of strength and sources of opportunity. Today, we don’t know what we don’t know.&#8221;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"&gt;The study will focus both on the Jewish needs—religious, educational and social—and on the health and human service needs of the community, enabling service providers to adjust to new realities and to plan for the long term.&#160;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"&gt;The Jewish Federation also plans to incorporate the study’s data and analysis into the Pittsburgh Jewish Community Scorecard, an online tool for people and organizations to review data about Jewish community performance. Using the Scorecard, programs and institutions can assess progress toward becoming a more vibrant, thriving, and engaged Jewish community. The data collected will add directly to the Pittsburgh Jewish Community Scorecard as it defines, spurs and measures the definition of a community of excellence.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"&gt;The Pittsburgh Jewish Community Scorecard committee plans follow-up research studies that will continue to measure community members’ behaviors and attitudes every two years.

The allocations, announced by the Federation’s Board of Directors, will support programs in Pittsburgh and in Jewish communities around the world.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"&gt;The allocations and grants consist of resources from the Federation’s Annual Campaign, the Jewish Community Foundation, supplemental donor gifts, government grants secured with Federation assistance, and a $900,000 human services block grant from the Jewish Healthcare Foundation.&#160;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"&gt;Funding decisions are the result of a year-long process that engages volunteers and professionals with diverse expertise, backgrounds and affiliations.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"&gt;&#8220;The Federation allocation and grantmaking process allows big-picture planning to use resources wisely and helps ensure that no segment of the community is left out,&#8221; explained Cynthia Shapira, chair of the Federation’s Board of Directors.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"&gt;Central to this process is a philosophy of providing core operating support to nine local beneficiary agencies and two overseas partners.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"&gt;&#8220;Federation allocations help each partner agency sustain a strong infrastructure,&#8221;&#160;Ms. Shapira continued. &#8220;Strong agencies can weather economic downturns, adapt to change and grow to meet new challenges. The agencies and affiliates can be lifelines to the people they serve and to the continuing health of the Jewish community. &#8221;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"&gt;A large portion of Federation allocations in 2016 will address aging and human needs in Pittsburgh. In addition to aiding some of Pittsburgh’s most vulnerable, in 2016 the Federation will continue to invest substantial dollars to address Jewish continuity by providing allocations to support Israel travel, Jewish preschool, and overnight Jewish camping.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"&gt;The 2016 allocations included a significant grant from the Federation’s Jewish Community Foundation to conduct a demographic study of Pittsburgh’s Jewish community. The study&#160;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"&gt;will be the first of its kind in Pittsburgh since 2002. Jeffrey Finkelstein, president and CEO of the Jewish Federation of Greater Pittsburgh, explained the significance of the study: &#8220;This study will provide information about the size of Pittsburgh’s Jewish community, the composition of our families and how Pittsburghers engage Jewishly. This information is crucial to identifying the community’s strengths and needs, and it’s crucial to planning to reach our potential.&#8221;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"&gt;Other disbursements from the Federation’s Jewish Community Foundation include, for example, grants to Repair the World, the Jewish Community Legacy Project, Classrooms Without Borders, and the National Council of Jewish Women’s Center for Women.&#160;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"&gt;The 2016 allocations from the Federation will enable an expansion of the Diller Teen Fellows program as it is conducted in Pittsburgh. Each year since 2009, 20 Diller Teen Fellows from Pittsburgh and 20 teens from Karmiel-Misgav, in Israel, participate in leadership-development and Jewish peoplehood activities. The 2016 allocation will provide outreach and programing to Diller alumni and to the parents of currently enrolled Pittsburgh teens.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"&gt;In Pittsburgh, the Diller Teen Fellows program is administered by Jewish Federation of Greater Pittsburgh’s Partnership2Gether program and the Jewish Community Center of Greater Pittsburgh. Additional funding for Diller Teen Fellows in Pittsburgh and worldwide comes from the Helen Diller Family Foundation.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"&gt;The nine local beneficiary agencies that receive Federation allocations are&#160;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li style="margin: 0 0 .5em 2rem;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"&gt;The Edward and Rose Berman Hillel Jewish University Center&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li style="margin: 0 0 .5em 2rem;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"&gt;Community Day School&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li style="margin: 0 0 .5em 2rem;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"&gt;Hillel Academy of Pittsburgh&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li style="margin: 0 0 .5em 2rem;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"&gt;Jewish Association on Aging&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li style="margin: 0 0 .5em 2rem;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"&gt;Jewish Community Center of Greater Pittsburgh&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li style="margin: 0 0 .5em 2rem;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"&gt;Jewish Family &amp; Children’s Service&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li style="margin: 0 0 .5em 2rem;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"&gt;Jewish Residential Services&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li style="margin: 0 0 .5em 2rem;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"&gt;Riverview Towers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li style="margin: 0 0 .5em 2rem;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"&gt;Yeshiva Schools&#160;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"&gt;The two overseas affiliates are the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee and the Jewish Agency for Israel.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"&gt;More information about Federation allocations and grantmaking is available from&#160;Adam Hertzman, director of marketing, at 412.992.5225 or &lt;a href="mailto:ahertzman@jfedpgh.org"&gt;ahertzman@jfedpgh.org&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 28 Jun 2016 18:42:00 GMT</pubDate><category>grants</category><category>funding</category><category>Cynthia Shapira</category><category>aging</category><category>Israel</category><category>preschool</category><category>overnight camp</category><category>Jeffrey Finkelstein</category><category>Repair the World</category><category>Jewish Community Legacy Project</category><category>Classrooms Without Borders</category><category>National Council of Jewish Women</category><category>Diller Teen Fellows</category><category>Karmiel-Misgav</category><category>Partnership2Gether</category><guid isPermaLink="false">ae42a676-b79e-4277-81bf-f9fd5aff7de5</guid></item><item><title>JEWISH FEDERATION OF GREATER PITTSBURGH PRESENTS  2016 GERALD S.

The goal of the program is to engage families with CDS through participation with CDS-involved families at Shabbat dinners. A grant to The Friendship Circle will help the organization fund a rooftop gardening club that will use new space to build client-volunteer relationships. The grant to Chabad of Pittsburgh will support Chabad’s second year of the very popular Love and Knaidels program. A women’s cooking program, Love and Knaidels offers participants the fun of cooking together and the joy of giving food to others.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"&gt;&#8220;It was very difficult to pick three grant proposals out of ten overall applications. But there’s so much creativity here in Pittsburgh, it’s a great problem to have,&#8221; said Aaron Morgenstern, the incoming SteelTree Board chair. &#8220;We’re excited to see what the community puts forth next year.&#8221;&#160;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"&gt;The SteelTree Fund, which combines support for the Jewish Federation’s Annual Campaign with support from the Federation’s Jewish Community Foundation, enables SteelTree board members to make a collective impact by designating micro-grants to local organizations and agencies.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"&gt;SteelTree is actively recruiting new board members. Board members are young adults ages 22-45 who have a desire to make a difference in the Jewish community and a passion for venture philanthropy.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"&gt;Over the past two years, the SteelTree board has created a vision, a set of values, a detailed scorecard and an evaluation process that help ensure the selection of deserving fundable projects. Grant proposals are measured on their potential impact on the community, degree of innovation and the extent to which the project would benefit local Jewish youth, teens and young adults.&#160;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"&gt;In 2015-16, the SteelTree Fund distributed $45,000 to support innovative community projects.

The shooting — which occurred early Sunday, June 12 — left 49 dead and 53 injured.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"&gt;&#8220;This is a profound act of terror,&#8221; said Cindy Goodman-Leib, chair of the Community Relations Council (CRC) of the Jewish Federation of Greater Pittsburgh. &#8220;We are devastated over this loss of life and stand in solidarity with the LGBT communities in Orlando, Pittsburgh, and throughout the world. As Jews, we understand what it is like to be targeted for no reason other than our identity, and we recognize that those who hate typically don’t only hate one group of people. Sunday morning’s attack happened to be directed at the LGBT community, but it could have just as easily been any one of us.&#8221;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"&gt;In addition to supporting and standing with our LGBT friends and allies, many of whom are part of the Jewish community, CRC will take three distinct actions as a result of this massacre:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li style="margin: 0 0 .5em 2rem;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"&gt;Work to promote a wider understanding of the LGBT community throughout Southwestern Pennsylvania&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li style="margin: 0 0 .5em 2rem;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"&gt;Advocate to prevent gun violence, at both a local and national level, while supporting the Second Amendment&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li style="margin: 0 0 .5em 2rem;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"&gt;In the wake of the shooter’s ties to radicalization, work to educate the Greater Pittsburgh community on the difference between Islamic extremism and Islam&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"&gt;May the victims’ memories be a blessing.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 14 Jun 2016 18:30:00 GMT</pubDate><category>Greater Pittsburgh Rabbinic Association</category><category>Holocaust Center of Pittsburgh</category><category>LGBT</category><category>Orlando</category><category>Florida</category><category>shooting</category><category>Community Relations Committee</category><category>CRC</category><guid isPermaLink="false">fd8e2913-d89e-445f-90a9-9befa891a597</guid></item><item><title>BIBLICAL SCHOLAR AND AUTHOR AVIVAH GOTTLEIB ZORNBERG MAKES FIRST PITTSBURGH VISIT TO PRESENT THREE-PART SERIES</title><link>http://ujfpittsburgh.org/News</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;" href="http://jfedpgh.org/file/press-releases/5-4-16_Avivah-Zornberg_FINAL.pdf"&gt;&lt;img alt="Download as PDF" height="25" src="http://ujfpittsburgh.org/image/digest-icons/pdf_icon_transparent.gif" width="25" /&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt;"&gt;&#160;PDF Version of this Press Release&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"&gt;&lt;img alt="Avivah Gottlieb Zornberg, PhD" height="219" src="http://ujfpittsburgh.org/image/people/gottlieb.zornberg.avivah2.png" style="float: left; margin: 0 10px 10px 0; border: 1px solid #c7c7c7;" width="200" /&gt;Biblical scholar and author Avivah Gottlieb Zornberg, Ph.D., will visit Pittsburgh for the first time in June and will present three lectures on significant Jewish topics.

Tikkun magazine called this work &#8220;a book to be studied &#8230; a modern midrash in its own right,&#8221; adding &#8220;a written text could never live up to the magic of her shiurim (teaching).&#8221; Among her other titles is the 2015 release &#8220;Bewilderments: Reflections on the Book of Numbers.&#8221;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"&gt;Born in London, Dr. Zornberg grew up and studied in Glasgow, Scotland, with her rabbi father, who was the head of a rabbinical court. She earned a Ph.D. in English literature from&#160;Cambridge University. After moving to Israel, she began teaching English literature at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem but soon turned her focus to teaching Torah. She has taught Torah in Jerusalem for 30 years. She holds a visiting lectureship at the London School of Jewish Studies.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"&gt;In Pittsburgh in June, each of Dr. Zornberg’s three lectures will be open to the public.

This year, attendees will also have a chance to hear Rabbi Bardack’s educational philosophy and get a sense of future educational directions.&#8221;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"&gt;&lt;img alt="Rabbi Amy Bardack" height="241" src="http://ujfpittsburgh.org/image/people/bardack.amy.jpg" style="float: left; margin: 0 10px 10px 0; border: 1px solid #c7c7c7;" width="161" /&gt;On July 1 Rabbi Amy Bardack will begin her duties as the Federation’s director of Jewish education and community capacity building. In her new position, she will work to ensure high-quality Jewish programs in the community, boost engagement of Jews of all ages and backgrounds and strengthen Jewish identity and leadership. Currently, she is the Judaic studies director, Solomon Schechter Day School of Greater Boston. Rabbi Bardack will bring to Pittsburgh more than 15 years of experience in day school settings. In that context she pioneered a new approach to Hebrew&#160;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"&gt;instruction, published two children’s prayer books and spearheaded several strategic planning and visioning processes. She has experience as a congregational rabbi, is the current president of the New England Rabbinical Assembly and was a fellow with Rabbis Without Borders.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"&gt;Rabbi Bardack holds a BA in religion from Columbia University and a master’s degree in Hebrew letters from American Jewish University. She received her rabbinic ordination from The Jewish Theological Seminary, New York City.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"&gt;The Harold Grinspoon Awards for Excellence in Jewish Education recognize skilled, innovative educators in day schools, religious schools and early childhood centers. Each year since 2000, the Harold Grinspoon Foundation has presented an award to an educator in up to 80 North American communities. Honorees are nominated by the organizations they serve. In Pittsburgh the award is supported by the Barbara and Lester Parker Fund for a Jewish Future Endowment of the Jewish Community Foundation and the Jewish Federation of Greater Pittsburgh. On May 22, at the Unsung Jewish Heroes event, Barbara Parker will present this year’s award.&#160;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"&gt;&lt;img alt="Jackie Goldblum" height="161" src="http://ujfpittsburgh.org/image/people/goldblum.jackie.jpg" style="float: left; margin: 0 10px 10px 0; border: 1px solid #c7c7c7;" width="161" /&gt;The Pittsburgh recipient of the 2016 Grinspoon Award is Jackie Goldblum, a middle school teacher at Community Day School (CDS), where she teaches history, comparative religion and Hebrew. The award recognizes Ms. Goldblum, who has taught at CDS for 17 years, for her consistent, effective classroom use of art, writing and primary source documents.&#160;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"&gt;Tzippy Mazer, head of Lower School and Hebrew/Jewish studies at CDS, noted several examples of Ms. Goldblum’s use of special projects to engage students: &#8220;Jackie took a leadership role in developing and implementing the curriculum for the 2016 Martin Luther King Jr. Day events at CDS. Instead of taking the day off, CDS took on the essential themes of this important day together with the broader Pittsburgh community.&#8221; In 2007, Ms. Goldblum initiated the Holocaust Survivor Dinner, an evening that was so successful that it has become an annual means of connecting 8th-graders with Survivors.&#160;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"&gt;Ms. Goldblum, reflecting on her goal as a Jewish educator, said, &#8220;My biggest reward will be if [students] remember me as a person that gave them the values of social justice and human rights. &#8230; If they see me in the street in twenty years, I hope that they will want to run up to me and tell me about their lives.&#8221;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"&gt;In addition to her work at CDS, Ms. Goldblum offers a weekly after-school human behavior-history program to students who attend school in Homewood and the Hill District. The focus of the program, made possible through a grant from the Alfred M. Oppenheimer&#160;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"&gt;Memorial Fund of The Pittsburgh Foundation’s CDS Holocaust Connections Endowment, is learning from history.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"&gt;Carolyn Linder, as Federation’s early childhood education manager, has overseen the planning of this year’s 2016 Unsung Jewish Heroes Celebration. &#8220;Whether you are an&#160;honoree’s colleague, family member or friend,&#8221; Ms. Linder commented, &#8220;or you are someone who recognizes the necessity of Jewish education as an important pathway to Jewish life — I encourage you to attend the Unsung Jewish Heroes celebration.&#8221;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"&gt;At the May 22 Unsung Jewish Heroes celebration, Scott Leib, chair, Federation’s Jewish Life &amp; Learning Committee, will serve as master of ceremonies.

To mark both occasions, the Jewish Federation of Greater Pittsburgh’s Partnership2Gether (P2G) program will offer Israel Week, May 8-15. Comprising dozens of activities to be offered in multiple locations in Pittsburgh and beyond, Israel Week will give Pittsburghers of all ages opportunities to learn, eat, dance and create with special guests, many from Israel.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"&gt;Israel Week will comprise both Yom Hazikaron, the worldwide day of remembrance dedicated to those who gave their lives for Israel, and Yom Ha’atzmaut, Israel’s independence day.&#160;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"&gt;&#8220;Yom Ha’atzmaut is always a cause to celebrate,&#8221; noted Israel Week Chair Jan Levinson, &#8220;but this year we’re pulling out the stops to highlight the mutual benefits of the P2G Partnership between Pittsburgh and Karmiel-Misgav.&#8221;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"&gt;Partnership2Gether, a program of the Jewish Agency for Israel, pairs Diaspora communities with Israeli communities. Worldwide, 500 communities participate. For the last 20 years — through Partnership2Gether, coordinated locally by the Jewish Federation of Greater Pittsburgh — Pittsburgh has had a sister-city relationship with the Israeli city of Karmiel and the region surrounding it, Misgav, in the Central Galilee.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"&gt;&#8220;Twenty years ago,&#8221; Mr. Levinson continued, &#8220;Pittsburghers began collaborating with Israelis, through what’s now Partnership2Gether, to develop mutually beneficial programs. Since then, through dozens of activities, P2G has nurtured connections between Pittsburghers and Israelis. Among the results have been personal growth, cultural exchange and cultivation of Jewish identity for young people and adults in both countries. Partnership2Gether’s Israel Week will be a way to celebrate and extend those connections.&#8221;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"&gt;The Jewish Community Center (JCC) of Greater Pittsburgh, 5738 Forbes Ave., will be the site of:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li style="margin: 0 0 .5em 2rem;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yom Hazikaron observance, Tuesday, May 10&lt;/strong&gt;, 8 p.m., Alex and Leona Robinson Building, Katz Theater. The somber remembrance will include the participation of a delegation of Israeli war veterans, whose presence is sponsored by American Friends of Israel War Disabled; the Karmei-Machol Dance Troupe, a young-adult ensemble from Karmiel-Misgav; and the Pittsburgh chapter of the HaZamir Choir.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li style="margin: 0 0 .5em 2rem;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yom Ha’atzmaut celebration, Thursday, May 12&lt;/strong&gt;, with activities scheduled at various times 4-9 p.m., throughout the JCC facility.

This fund will promote diverse communities in the Pittsburgh region. Each organization has committed $25,000 to create a $50,000 pool to fund projects that increase the civic engagement of diverse and immigrant communities.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"&gt;Melanie Harrington, CEO of Vibrant Pittsburgh, is thrilled about the foundation’s participation. &#8220;We are pleased to team up with the Jewish Federation because they have been providing services for more than a century to Pittsburgh’s immigrant and diverse communities. In addition, this is our fourth cycle of funding grants to community groups, so this partnership allows us to expand our resources and engagement.&#8221;&#160;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"&gt;Cindy Goodman-Leib, chair of the Community Relations Council, explained how the partnership between the Urban Affairs Foundation and Vibrant Pittsburgh resulted: &#8220;Several Jewish Federation agencies have been Vibrant Pittsburgh grant recipients. The value of those grant projects underlined our conviction at the Jewish Federation’s Urban Affairs Foundation that healthy diverse communities contribute to the vitality of the region as a whole. We see awarding Mini Grants as a means of building the region in the way the foundation’s mission statement specifies: &#8216;to foster amicable relationships among ethnic, racial, national, religious and other groups in our community.’ &#8221;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"&gt;Funding through the Vibrant Pittsburgh-Urban Affairs Foundation’s 2016 Civic Inclusion &amp; Engagement Fund initiative will be available to applicants selected through a competitive proposal process.

Organizations can partner with other nonprofits, academic institutions, religious organizations, community groups, businesses and employee resource groups.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"&gt;Projects eligible for Mini Grant funding should:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li style="margin: 0 0 .5em 2rem;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"&gt;Create opportunities for civic engagement that result in a more inclusive and engaged multicultural region, and&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li style="margin: 0 0 .5em 2rem;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"&gt;Be collaborative by engaging diverse communities, organizations, or partners.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"&gt;The term of proposed projects should be one year.

The program — to be held at the Jewish Community Center of Greater Pittsburgh, 5738 Forbes Ave., Squirrel Hill — will examine whether we can be welcoming to refugees and still maintain a safe community. Three panelists — Aryeh Sherman, Mark Hetfield and Michael Kenney, PhD — a group with expertise in refugee resettlement and terrorism, will contribute informed views and invite attendees’ questions.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"&gt;Four organizations will co-sponsor the program: the Community Relations Council of the Jewish Federation of Greater Pittsburgh, Jewish Family &amp; Children’s Service of Pittsburgh, the Holocaust Center of Pittsburgh and the Jewish Community Center (JCC) of Greater Pittsburgh.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"&gt;&#8220;As American Jews, it is important to engage the community in a conversation about refugees,&#8221; said Cindy Goodman-Leib, chair of the Federation’s Community Relations Council (CRC). &#8220;Welcoming the stranger is an integral part of our tradition. More than 30 times throughout the Torah, we read about the importance of being welcoming. Additionally, many Jewish families have come to the United States as refugees, fleeing persecution and violence. At the same time, we must be mindful of our community’s safety and security. This program will help to inform us as we respond to today’s refugee crisis.&#8221;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"&gt;&#8220;In speaking to our constituents in the community, we’ve come to realize that many people have limited information about the refugee crisis,&#8221; says CRC Director Josh Sayles. &#8220;An educated community is an empowered community. We are taking it upon ourselves to inform Pittsburghers about the difference between refugees and immigrants, the process of vetting refugees, and the potential challenges and dangers, if any, of welcoming them into our community. We feel the best way to accomplish this goal is in the form of a community conversation.&#8221;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"&gt;The extensive knowledge of the three panelists at the Feb. 25 program will help program attendees understand the logistics and challenges of the refugee crisis.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style="overflow: hidden;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"&gt;&lt;img alt="Aryeh Sherman" height="auto" src="http://ujfpittsburgh.org/image/people/sherman.aryeh.jpg" style="margin: 0px 10px 10px 0px; border: 1px solid #c7c7c7; float: left;" width="100" /&gt;Since 1999, Aryeh Sherman has served as president and CEO of Jewish Family &amp; Children’s Service of Pittsburgh (JF&amp;CS), a nonprofit agency.

Rabbi Bardack, currently the Judaic studies director, Solomon Schechter Day School of Greater Boston, will begin her duties in Pittsburgh on July 1, 2016.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"&gt;&#8220;This is truly a dream opportunity for me,&#8221; said Rabbi Bardack, &#8220;to have an impact on Jewish learning, from childhood through elder years, in a community committed to growth and continuous improvement. I am so impressed with the strength of Jewish life in Greater Pittsburgh, and I am excited to work with Pittsburgh’s many educational partners in thinking about how to move Jewish education to the next level of excellence.&#8221;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"&gt;In her new position, Rabbi Bardack will work to ensure high-quality Jewish programs in the community, boost engagement of Jews of all ages and backgrounds and strengthen Jewish identity and leadership. Among the groups with which she will collaborate are the Jewish Life and Learning Commission, the Centennial Fund for a Jewish Future Grant-Making Committee and the Day School Council.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"&gt;Rabbi Bardack will bring to Pittsburgh more than 15 years of experience in day school settings. In that context she pioneered a new approach to Hebrew instruction, published two children’s prayer books and spearheaded several strategic planning and visioning processes. She has experience as a congregational rabbi, is the current president of the New England Rabbinical Assembly and was a fellow with Rabbis Without Borders.&#160;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"&gt;Rabbi Bardack holds a BA in religion from Columbia University and a master’s degree in Hebrew letters from American Jewish University. She received her rabbinic ordination from The Jewish Theological Seminary, New York City.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"&gt;In describing Rabbi Bardack’s background, Deborah Baron — chief operating officer, Jewish Federation of Greater Pittsburgh — said, &#8220;Amy brings a wealth of experience in innovating new programs, strategic planning and visioning. She has the ability to understand the needs of unique institutions while seeing the larger community picture. At the Federation, we are excited to welcome Amy and her family to Pittsburgh.&#8221;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"&gt;Rabbi Bardack will move to Pittsburgh with her husband — Jared Magnani, MD — and children Ilan (age 14) and Orelle (age 12). Dr. Magnani, who is board-certified in internal medicine and cardiovascular medicine, will work as a physician and researcher at the University of Pittsburgh.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"&gt;Rabbi Bardack’s position at the Federation arises from the Federation’s adoption, in 2015, of the lifespan education programs of the Agency for Jewish Learning (AJL). The Jewish Community Center of Greater Pittsburgh now operates what were AJL’s teen programs.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"&gt;The first public event at which Pittsburgh’s Jewish community will be able to meet&#160;Rabbi Bardack will be at the Unsung Jewish Heroes Awards, Sunday, May 22, 5-6 p.m., Jewish Community Center of Greater Pittsburgh, Squirrel Hill.

The award recipient must, as a recognized role model, inspire service on behalf of the Jewish community.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"&gt;In announcing the award, Community Day School Head of School Avi Baran Munro noted, &#8220;It is rare when an entire school feels the impact of a single teacher, but Eileen Freedman’s impact cannot be understated. Eileen has done no less than revolutionize the educational experience at Community Day School by creating a hands-on, integrated global music program, in a Jewish context, that inspires our students to love learning music, and she has organized events that unite and galvanize our entire community.&#8221;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"&gt;Reacting to the announcement, Mrs. Freedman said, &#8220;I am both thrilled and honored to be receiving this level of recognition in our community. To know that my work in music education is valued so highly in the school and Jewish community gives me a tremendous sense of accomplishment and pride, and receiving this award as a music educator speaks volumes about the importance of the arts in the lives of our students.&#8221;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"&gt;At CDS, Mrs. Freedman teaches general music, and she organizes and leads music events at the school — events such as the regular every-other-Friday Kabbalat Shabbat, the biannual Zimriah and the Drum Olam ensemble she created. She has also organized many Jewish music events within CDS and outside the school, including a recent visit by Rachman Nachman, a 28-year-old hip-hop-inspired Ugandan Jewish cantor. The award recognizes her exceptional ability and commitment to providing an excellent music education to the students at CDS and to the broader Jewish community.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"&gt;Mrs. Freedman began her career at Community Day School in 2005. Previously, she worked as a music specialist at the Jewish Community Center of Pittsburgh’s James and Rachel Levinson Day Camp. She was a Kindermusik educator and served as a cantorial soloist at Tree of Life Congregation. She taught Sunday-school music at Congregation Beth Shalom for 10 years. She has participated in numerous workshops and certification courses, including World Music Drumming, Dalcroze, and Orff Schulwerk. She is a certified Orff teacher through the University of the Arts at Villanova University. She incorporates many aspects of this creative music and movement approach into her teaching.&#160;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"&gt;The Federation seeks nominees for the Ira and Nanette Gordon Community Professional Achievement Award each spring.
